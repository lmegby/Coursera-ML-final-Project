# Coursera-ML-final-Project

Load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Building model using KNN, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation. Building model using Decision Tree and find the accuracy evaluation. Building model using SVM and find the accuracy evaluation. Building model using Logistic Regression and find the accuracy evaluation. The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics: Jaccard index, F1-score, and LogLoss.
